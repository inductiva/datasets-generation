# Dataset Generation

The purpose of this repository is to store scripts for dataset generation using the Inductiva API, which is then
post-processed and packaged as HuggingFace datasets, that are easily loadable in Machine Learning pipelines.


## Current Datasets

- **WindTunnel** : data generated by OpenFOAM where a shape (typically a vehicle) is placed inside a virtual
  wind tunnel where air enters with a given speed, and things like surface pressure, stream lines and
  drag coefficients are computed.
